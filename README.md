# Color Flipper

This is a basic Vanilla JS project where the background color of the body element is changed when a button is clicked. There are two pages in this project, simple and hex.

Simple page randomly generates a color from green, red, blue and yellow and assigns it to the body of the page.

Hex page randomly generates a hexadecimal code for a color on the fly and assigns it to the body of the page.

I have followed John Smilga's Vannila JS projects tutorial on YouTube and built this page. I have not designed the CSS. I have only built the JavaScript functionality(app.js for simple and hex.js for hex) to gain a better understanding and grasp on my JS skills.

app.js and hex.js are Open Source. Feel free to use this code as a reference for your projects but please give me credits, coz, let's agree, leaching sucks!
